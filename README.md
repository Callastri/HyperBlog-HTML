# HyperBlog HTML

Welcome to my first web development project! 🚀

This repository contains my solution for the **[HyperBlog HTML](https://hyperskill.org/projects/416)** project from the [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/) (JetBrains Academy) Frontend Developer track.

## 📖 About
I am currently studying HTML and CSS to build a strong foundation in web development. This project is my very first step in applying the theory I've learned so far.

The goal of this project was to create a static web page that demonstrates:
* Semantic HTML structure

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5** - For structure and content

## 💻 How to Run
Since this is a static website, you don't need to install anything!

1.  Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
2.  Navigate to the project folder.
3.  Double-click on `index.html` to open it in your web browser.

## 🎓 What I Learned
During this project, I learned how to:
* Structure a webpage using proper HTML tags.
* Create a header section for the blog and add the title and navigation links.
* Create an aside section for the blog and add a list of popular articles.
* Create a main section for the blog and add articles.
* Create a footer section for the blog and add various information such as address.

## 👏 Acknowledgements
* Thanks to **Hyperskill** for the clear curriculum and project guidelines.
